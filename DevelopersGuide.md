# Developer's Guide #

This document provides a brief for setting up development environment for Geogia.

# Mininum Requirements #

For getting started, you just need:

  * Grails 0.6 (http://grails.org)
  * Eclipse Europa (3.3)
  * Subclipse 1.2.4

You also need to set GRAILS\_HOME to point to your Grails directory.

# Quick Start #

After fetching code from SVN, just type **grails run-app**.
Current Geogia is using Grails scaffolding, so you should see CRUD pages for all available domain classes.
